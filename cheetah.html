        <p>The <em>Cheetah</em> is awesome because it is part of the cat family and can run <strong>super fast</strong>. It is also very good at hiding and stalking it's pray. Unlike <em>most</em> cats, they are daytime hunters, so they <strong>don't have night vision</strong>. Instead, they have two long stripes on their face called,"tear stripes". Tear stripes help protect cheetahs' eyes from the sun.</p>
